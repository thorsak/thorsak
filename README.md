--->As a retired Chemist & Programmer, I'm interested to HELP Mozilla to eliminate several flaws/mistakes in DAILY-USED 'THUNDERBIRD' Software
which I'm using for SEVERAL years, and I like it very much EXCEPT - I want to HELP Mozilla to make Thunderbird even 'MUCH MORE BELOVED' BY MANY
OTHER Users after we could ELIMINATE SEVERAL ERRORS to help OFTEN VERY FRUSTRATED Users which often suffer by their DRASTICALLY REDUCED PRODUCTIVITY
due to these UNNECESSARY & AVOIDABLE (!) Errors and/or SHORTCOMINGS in the Thunderbird Software design. 
Now some practical NOTES for your getting more familiar with my background:
- I live in the State of Washington NEAR SEATTLE/Everett area (in the City of Marysville) therefore I would work with Mozilla ONLINE through Email and 'Chat'
- I have EXTENSIVE WORKING EXPERIENCE in the Development & Design of new ANALYTICAL (Testing) METHODS in the Phramaceutical Industry (e.g. Johnson & Johnson
Corporation) as Senior Research Chemist which involved EXTENSIVE Quality Assurance INSPECTIONS (INVESTIGATIONS) to CONFIRM the VALIDITY/REPRODUCIBILITY/
PRODUCTIVITY/Overall USELFULNESS & IMPROVEMENTS of newly developed METHODS & PROCEDURES.
